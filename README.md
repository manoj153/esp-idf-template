# Notes for starting new ESP32 Projects

 ## How to add own C source file to compile during ```make``` ?

 - ```mkdir``` **components** in ```project_directory```  and put all the C source files.
 
 -  ```touch``` **component.mk** inside the  **components** directory<b>,</b>  **component.mk** contains info on what files to include during ```make```

 Example snippet of component.mk below :

 ```
#
# Main Makefile. This is basically the same as a component makefile.
#
# (Uses default behaviour of compiling all source files in directory, adding 'include' to include path.)

COMPONENT_SRCDIRS := . 
COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS := .
 ```
 
The tree look of the directory **components** with the source  and it's header files
```
components/
├── component.mk
├── esp_mesh.h
├── mesh_light.h
└── mesh_main.c
```


## How to add modules of large library to compile during ```make flash``` ?
- The sources are inside a each folder containing all the depedent C codes and headers

The tree look of the directory **components** with the source  and it's header files

```
components/
│
├── spidriver
│   ├── component.mk
│   ├── spi_master_lobo.c
│   └── spi_master_lobo.h
├── spiffs
│   ├── component.mk
│   └── esp_spiffs.c
└── tft
    ├── component.mk
    ├── tftspi.c
    └── tftspi.c
```

## How to create or modify the config that appears when ```make menuconfig```

- The ```Kconfig``` file located inside **components** directory responsible to allow add our own custom set of configuration options and the value types in the list

The working structure of the file as below <br />

\<menu name> ,  \<data_type>, \<the value name>, \<data range INTEGER>, \<default_val>, \<help_prompt>, \<promp_message>
```
config MWIFI_VOTE_PERCENTAGE
    int "Vote percentage threshold above which the node becoms a root"
    range 1 100
    default 90
    help
        Vote percentage threshold above which the node becoms a root
```

- Further information about ```Kconfig``` found here https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
