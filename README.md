# Notes for starting new ESP32 Projects

 ## How to add own C source file to compile during ```make``` ?

 - ```mkdir``` **components** in ```project_directory```  and put all the C source files.
 
 -  ```touch``` **component.mk** inside the  **components** directory<b>,</b>  **component.mk** contains info on what files to include during ```make```

 Example snippet of component.mk below :

 ```
#
# Main Makefile. This is basically the same as a component makefile.
#
# (Uses default behaviour of compiling all source files in directory, adding 'include' to include path.)

COMPONENT_SRCDIRS := . 
COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS := .
 ```
 
The tree look of the directory components 
```
components/
├── component.mk
├── esp_mesh.h
├── mesh_light.h
└── mesh_main.c
```


## How to add modules of large library to compile during ```make flash``` ?
- Put source inside a foldering containing all the depedent C codes
